# [HTTPS is actually everywhere.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere)

We learned about HTTP protocl in class last week, so I thought it would be nice to share how one of the extensions I use, HTTPS Everywhere, is being deprecated as the goal of having HTTPS almost everywhere is a function built into most browsers and most websites. Cybersecurity and online privacy isn't something that most people really think about, so I think it's really important that organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation really push tech companies in that direction.

I completely agree with what Matt said. I am honestly very impressed with the progression of HTTP have made since it was created. HTTP became the official world protocol for developers. If https do not exist, whole people in the world will be panicked. It is also very cool to see how all different kinds of browsers, such as firefox, chrome, brave, safari, and edge, are all following the http protocol in order to connect everywhere in the world.
