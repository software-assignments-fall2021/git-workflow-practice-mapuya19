# [HTTPS is actually everywhere.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere)

We learned about HTTP protocl in class last week, so I thought it would be nice to share how one of the extensions I use, HTTPS Everywhere, is being deprecated as the goal of having HTTPS almost everywhere is a function built into most browsers and most websites. Cybersecurity and online privacy isn't something that most people really think about, so I think it's really important that organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation really push tech companies in that direction.
